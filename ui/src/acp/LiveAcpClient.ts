/**
 * Live ACP client (Phase 1+2): speaks v1 ACP over an injected `AcpTransport`
 * (issue #20) to an already-running ACP service — Panda never spawns or
 * manages the agent process, it only consumes the protocol. The transport is
 * caller-injected, so nothing in this class knows whether the wire is a
 * browser WebSocket, stdio or anything else.
 *
 * Feeds the same handlers the replay driver feeds (update / status /
 * permission) plus connection and session bookkeeping, so the store wiring
 * stays symmetrical between the two drivers.
 *
 * v1 semantics are synthesized here: `session/prompt` stays pending for the
 * whole turn, so the client itself drives running → requires_action → idle.
 * (v2's state_update notifications will slot in at this same seam.)
 *
 * Session lifecycle (Phase 2): capabilities gate everything; reconnect prefers
 * `session/resume` (transcript preserved, no replay), falls back to
 * `session/load` (history replayed onto a clean document), else starts fresh.
 *
 * Session switches are transactional (issue #17): `session/load` stages the
 * target first and commits only on success — a failure rolls the client's
 * routing and the driver's snapshot back, so the previous session stays
 * fully rendered and the switch is retryable. The settled pointer semantics:
 * `connection.sessionId` / `activeSessionId` only move on commit.
