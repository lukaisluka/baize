 * Closure observation (the #20 review's fail-fast check found this the hard
 * way): the SDK stream's `readable` is a bare WHATWG ReadableStream, which has
 * no `closed` property — only readers do, and stealing a reader would starve
 * the SDK's own consumption. The genuinely observable signals are the
 * underlying WebSocket's `close`/`error` events, so the transport injects an
